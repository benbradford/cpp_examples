Wrapping up all the lessons so far

Bringing together everything looked at so far to make a game of yahtzee on the command line.

Type numbers 1 - 5 to hold dice.
Type r to roll again
Type s to enter score (you have to enter a score after the 3rd roll)
Type q to quit

To run this program, from this directory, do the following:


`make`               - starts compiling and generating the executable<br>
`bin/yahtzee`       	 - run the created executable
