Read in two ints and output the product.

If you get a compiler error, try and correct it, then re-run 'make' from the command line 

To run this program, from this directory, do the following:

`mkdir bin`          	  - this will create a directory for our binaries<br>
`cd bin`             	  - enter this directory<br>
`cmake ..`           	  - invokes CMakelists.txt and places binaries in bin folder<br>
`make`               	  - starts compiling and generating the executable<br>
`./branches_conditionals` - run the created executable
