For this lesson, look for the TODO comments

You will need to swap over the first and last elements of an array of characters.

There are multiple ways of doing this, but for this exercise, the swap must
take place in a function taking two char references.

To run this program, from this directory, do the following:

`mkdir bin`          - this will create a directory for our binaries<br>
`cd bin`             - enter this directory<br>
`cmake ..`           - invokes CMakelists.txt and places binaries in bin folder<br>
`make`               - starts compiling and generating the executable<br>
`./references`       - run the created executable
