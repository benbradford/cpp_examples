Wrapping up all the lessons so far

THIS IS A WIP, needs some work

`mkdir bin`          - this will create a directory for our binaries<br>
`cd bin`             - enter this directory<br>
`cmake ..`           - invokes CMakelists.txt and places binaries in bin folder<br>
`make`               - starts compiling and generating the executable<br>
`./yahtzee`       	 - run the created executable
